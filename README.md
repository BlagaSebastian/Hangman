# Hangman
This is my version of the classic Hangman game.

For this game to work, we need two players. One that selects a word and the other that tries to guess it.
In order to have a smooth game a made my program in such way to ensure all the rules are respected:
  Player 1 can chouse only a valid word and his input is hidden.
  Player 2 can chouse every letter only once and he is having a limited number of tries.
